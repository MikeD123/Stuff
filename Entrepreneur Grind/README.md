*Notes I share with others. No idea if they're correct, more that time to figure these lessons out took me longer than most (like everything else in life, lol!)*

**Whatever you are doing read this email with every ounce of energy you have. Don't be distracted while this formula is being downloaded into your brain. It's one of the most valuable emails you'll ever receive**

First - Be prepared for an ultra grind. Because it is. Set your expectations up front. It's hard work, it's really f'ing tough, and requires a huge amount of grit. Regardless of going through a top tier accelerator like BoostVC, they will set you up for success, but they're not going to make VC's write checks for you. So knowing the hard yards will be better up front... 99 no's 1 yes. That's the most likely situation. Check this out... From when I finished Boost this is my approximate breakdown.

**My strategy was wrong. First time ever raising money so I went spray and pray. Now I advise the teams that I mentor to do the following, so you should do the following steps guys:**

Open a google spreadsheet.

Column A - Find a list of company's similar (not competitors) to yours. Payments, mobile, overseas, niche markets, whatever it be.

Column B - Goto the crunchbase of those company's, find their investor list. Get all of the names and put them in here.

Column C - Of the funds from the crunchbase in Column B, now find the rounds that are relevant to you. So don't look at an investor who did the Series-C of "Verse" or whatever, because you're not Series-C. That's a nice convo to have for long play, but you need to get this done, now.

Column D - Of the firms/angels/whatever from Column C, find the specific investor who did that deal at the firm. E.g. When A16Z invests in Coinbase, they're not all investing in Coinbase, it's one of the partners/general partners team who champions the deal, and then they sit around and acknowledge this person as their in house expert partner at this vertical (e.g. crypto in this example). So don't just go looking for any person at A16Z who gives you the time of day, because you might be pitching a crypto company to the partner who focuses on Health Tech or some shit, etc... Haha... Sure it feels nice saying "Got a meeting with A16Z", but this is not a dick measuring contest to tell your mates, this is the grind, and it's as real as it gets. You are asking strangers for vast sums of money, and you are trying to do this as fast as possible so you can get back into your code and keep executing. Fundraising is unfortunately a necessary, but it's a very draining distraction.

Column E - When you've found the partners that do the relevant deals at firms which are relevant to you, now you've got to get a dialogue started. Put the relevant partners name in this column.

Next step - Find them on LinkedIn.

Column F - Paste their profile URL here. // THIS IS YOUR IDEAL HIT LIST THAT YOU ARE AIMING TO STRIVE FOR. POSSIBLE THAT YOUR LEAD INVESTOR IS SITTING IN THIS PILE OF NAMES.

Column G - Open the "mutual connections" and if you have any, put the top three that YOU are closest with.

Write an email to the mutual connections, or do it via LinkedIn's introduction request thing that they've got. In your email to them, specify that you would like a "warm introduction"... This is clutch guys. If someone is forced to make an intro, people can smell that. But if someone is singing your praises and tapping their name and reputation on the introduction by singing your praises, that'll 10x the likely conversation engagement, their placebo effect of opinion when they go into the conversation etc... Instead of a "yeah, fine, I'll do a favor and hear them rant etc..."

Column H. You then have two choices. If you've got a lot of very close mates who are also close with them, you can either
Get the warmest to intro you to them and get others to double down and drop an email about you guys crushing it (not intro'ing, just talking about you guys or tweeting about you, etc...). Essentially surrounding the investor with noise, about you.
Get all your mutual connections to make intro's. These two choices depend on how close you are to them etc... Different for different situations :) 
Now when you get the intro, be as prompt as possible in replying and your turnaround in response. People emailing you are likely in "email mode" so capitalize on replying fast to get their next reply back while they're zoning in email mode. If not, then at least you tick the box and get it off your plate as fast as possible and onto the next introduction.
Without brain dumping too much, does this make sense guys?

You're now getting high quality, high probability, mother f'ing laser level accuracy on the conversations you're engaging. Zero fat or uncertainty about talking to "the wrong firm" or "the wrong contact", etc... Tell me if something seems wrong, but I'm pretty sure that this is the closest thing to a bible for fundraising, that could ever exist. 

**FYI - I am terrible at fundraising, and know the above points through tripping over myself a zillion times. Even though I'm bad at it, I work really hard, which compensates for lack of natural ability compared to others who just "get it" or have the resume of Stanford/Uber/Facebook/Harvard/etc... I don't have any of that, haha... Not sure what category you fit in, but you should be working your ass off regardless - **cracks whip** - Hahaha... But seriously, embrace the grind.

Boost breeds grinders. There's a reason that they've got their own personally branded Ledger crypto wallets that say "Be the cockroach"...**

**Last point**

As an entrepreneur, you'll get firehosed with information about what to do. This is an example of that. The skill is in being able to filter it to your situation. That's the skill you need. Basically, this could be complete misinformation, it could be on point. Don't take every person's advice as correct. Filter feedback, respectfully. Dignify it with thought, evaluate, decide whether or not to incorporate it.

Good luck!
