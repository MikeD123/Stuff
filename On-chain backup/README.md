## HashShot - Token teams could avoid restarting from scratch if bug or systemic error.

Periodic snapshots of current balances/asset holders, hashed, and then applied into a transaction on the chain with the longest duration of immutability (basically the hardest in the room to bs).

## How come?

The premise that teams don't must operate as if things will be immutable is likely going to create unneccessary risk to the ecosystem. Even more as the "smart contract composability" hype train keeps it's pace.

A fantastic problem to have of course, but it poses a risk for the longer term should a contract bug/hack/compromize/etc... It's set a good foundation for best practices, and cautiously executing which is great. Moving forward, assets that are going to move faster, and expirement would likely want to have something like this.

## Muh immutable

I don't think that there's problems with other chains or tokens reverting some sort of deployment. Such early days means experimentation will likely yield faster iterations to see what sticks.

The main key part is to manage expectations. If you are very transparent to the token holders that in the future this may/may not be a thing etc... People won't mind. If people are under a different assumption, then likely turns into pitchforks.
