## ERC-20 Token Porting (E.g. Ethereum ERC-20 --> Binance DEX)

### Context

Interoperability between chains can be achieved using a commit/reveal scheme. Both parties lock into a transaction with only two possible outcomes. Completely swap assets, or both parties keep their current holdings. All or nothing, it either happens or it doesn't happen.

### Problem

The needs for solutions that provide far "less clunkiness" has always been thought discussed, but rarely implemented. So far, teams are utilizing various methods to achieve a cross-chain replica, or trade.

### Solution

### Examples

* **Summa.One** - Trade Example - Utilizing a variety of methods to accomodate for different complexities. The implementation being the most professional and secure afaict. We interviewed James & Matt on our podcast. Super nice people, that are OG's in the space.  ** *Turns shilling upto 11* ** [Check it out here to learn more](https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/ep-26-unifying-blockchains-elegantly-via-cross-chain/id1432912612?i=1000431691751).


* **WBTC** - Mint Example - This essentially utilizes a centralized custodian model. Transfer Bitcoin to their wallet, they then mint you a BTC token. I like the initiative, but I don't like this implementation (personally). The supply side, aka people who are transferring Bitcoin to the custodian weren't really considered in this. They need to disclose personal information
