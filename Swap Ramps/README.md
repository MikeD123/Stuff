A teacher is going to issue a prize to the students if they get their work done. We have a classroom full of 5 students. The format today is different from that of what it usually is.

**Old format - Winner take all**

The teacher will an answer to an equation on the board. Although, one of the inputs is missing and the goal is to be the first to find the missing input. First student to solve it will receive the whole packet containing 5 chocolates.

**New format - Rewarded if completed**
